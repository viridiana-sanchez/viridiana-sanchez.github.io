## Projects
#### Leverage Machine Learning to Create Recommendation Systems
Developed a content-based movie recommender using natural language processing that achieved a cosine similarity above 0.8, ensuring users receive highly relevant and personalized movie suggestions. Built a neural collaborative filtering model with a 0.8 RMSE, highlighting the system’s predictive performance in accurately recommending movies on predicted ratings derived from users’ historical rating behavior.
