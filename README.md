## Projects
#### Leverage Machine Learning to Create Recommendation Systems [View](https://github.com/viridiana-sanchez/Movie-Machine-Learning-Portfolio)
Developed a content-based movie recommender using natural language processing that achieved a cosine similarity above 0.8, ensuring users receive highly relevant and personalized movie suggestions.
Built a neural collaborative filtering model with a 0.8 RMSE, highlighting the system’s predictive performance in accurately recommending movies on predicted ratings derived from users’ historical rating behavior.

#### Predictive Modeling with SciKit-Learn and TensorFlow
[View](https://github.com/viridiana-sanchez/Movie-Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/Predictive-Modeling-ScikitLearn-and-Tensorflow.ipynb)
Implemented feature engineering strategies such as interaction terms and polynomial features to achieve a 20% reduction in Mean Squared Error across regression models to enhance precision. Leveraged the power of ensemble learning with random forest regression, achieving a 15% increase in R-squared values and significantly improving model explainability and predictive accuracy

#### Decoding Data: A Step-by-Step Guide to Exploratory Data Analysis
Authored an EDA guide for dataset of 52,000 movies using Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Sci-Kit Learn that aims to increase users’ data literacy by 25% and improve their efficiency in exploring and interpreting data patterns through descriptive and inferential statistics, correlation matrix and visualizations.
