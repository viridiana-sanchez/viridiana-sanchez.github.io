#### Business Analyst @ Washington State DCYF

#### Data Analyst @ Division of Partnership, Prevention, and Services, Washington State DCYF
- Designed and implemented data systems to support the statewide launch of new foster program, enabling precise tracking and reporting of child welfare outcomes across 8,750 licensed homes and over 4,000 foster youth.
- Streamlined data workflows, leveraging PowerBI, and Excel Power Query, reducing reporting delays and accelerating decision making processes.
- Developed strategic metrics and dynamic performance dashboards using Excel and Tableau, directly informing program improvements for foster youth placement and caregiver retention.


#### Data Analyst - Independent Contractor @ California State University San Marcos
- Optimized statistical analysis and visualizations through data analysis using SPSS, R, and Excel.
- Conducted power simulations in R for growth curve modeling and regression, ensuring statistical robustness and validity with data from 150+ participant responses.
- Organized and presented weekly reports on methodology and outcomes to improve stakeholder understanding.


#### Research Lab Manager @ California State University San Marcos
[Culture + Intergroup Relations Lab](https://www.kimellab.com/)
- Led a 14-member team across 5 research projects, collaborating with the principal investigator on project design, execution and data analysis planning.
- Automated pre-processing of 200+ survey responses, DNA genetic results and salivary analysis using R scripts, SPSS, and Excel, reducing data processing time and enhancing research output quality and reliability.
- Boosted study participation from 7 to 120+, securing $3,000 in additional funding and extending study duration.

## Projects
#### Leverage Machine Learning to Create Recommendation Systems
Developed a content-based movie recommender using natural language processing that achieved a cosine similarity above 0.8, ensuring users receive highly relevant and personalized movie suggestions. Built a neural collaborative filtering model with a 0.8 RMSE, highlighting the system’s predictive performance in accurately recommending movies on predicted ratings derived from users’ historical rating behavior.
